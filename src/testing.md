Looking at your code, I can see that you already have a query string parameter for membership activation! The system is set up to check for a membership parameter in the URL, which will automatically set the membership cookie.

Let me show you how to test it:

Testing with Query String
You can test the membership system by adding ?membership=test_token to your video page URL:

When you visit this URL, the system will:

Set a membership cookie that expires in 1 year
Remove the token from the URL for security
Show a success message: "✓ Membership activated! Enjoy unlimited video access."
Update the membership status to show "✓ Premium Member"
Bypass the 1-minute timer restriction
Testing Different Scenarios
Test membership activation:

Test membership reset:

Test with video and membership:

How the Cookie System Works
The membership cookie stores:

token: The membership identifier
expires: Expiration timestamp (1 year from activation)
activated: When the membership was first activated
The cookie is set as:

SameSite=Strict for security
path=/ to work across your entire site
Expires in 1 year
Testing the Full Flow
Test free user (no membership):

Visit the video page normally
Play a video and wait 1 minute
The upgrade message should appear
Test membership activation:

Add ?membership=test_token to the URL
You should see the success message
The membership status should show "✓ Premium Member"
Videos should play without time limits
Test membership persistence:

After activating membership, navigate away and come back
The membership should still be active (cookie persists)
Test membership reset:

Add ?reset_membership=true to reset and test again
This gives you a complete testing workflow without needing to integrate with Stripe during development!
